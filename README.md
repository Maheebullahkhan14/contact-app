# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Contact Form Page with React.js, Redux, Redux Toolkit, and React Spring

This project is a simple Contact Form Page built using **React.js**, **Redux**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **React Spring** for animations. It allows users to submit their contact information, with a smooth, animated interface.

## Features

- **Contact Form**: A simple form to collect name, email, and message.
- **State Management**: Uses **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit** to manage form state and handle form submission.
- **Animations**: Utilizes **React Spring** to animate the form and elements for a smooth user experience.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that the form inputs are valid before submission.
- **Responsive Design**: The form layout is fully responsive and works across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A state management tool for JavaScript applications.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A set of tools to simplify Redux development and improve its structure.
- **React Spring**: A spring-physics-based animation library for React.
- **React Hook Form** (optional, if used for form validation and submission handling).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-form-page.git


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
